Here are all my various bots for Telegram that I have created for purposes such as:
1) len.py - search for roots of a quadratic equation
2) Prof(2).py - help students in choosing a profession 
3) ProfMRK.py - helps applicants to my college to choose the most suitable major for them
4) Lost(2).py - a bot that uses a database to help students find lost items.
